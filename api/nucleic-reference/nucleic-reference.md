## Nucleic class

The `mdna.nucleic` module is the core of the MDNA toolkit, encompassing a variety of classes and functions essential for DNA structure generation, manipulation, and analysis. Below, each key component of the module is outlined with explanations of its purpose and usage. The `Nucleic` class serves as the primary interface for interacting with DNA structures in the MDNA toolkit. It encapsulates both the structural properties of DNA and the trajectory information needed for molecular dynamics simulations. Key methods include:
