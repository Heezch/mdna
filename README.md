# MDNA: Molecular DNA Structure Generation and Analysis Toolkit

## Description
MDNA is a powerful molecular modeling tool designed to bridge the gap in generating starting structures for DNA and DNA-protein complexes for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By leveraging rigid body models, this tool enhances the precision in representing DNA structures, allowing for the inclusion of non-canonical bases, the adjustment of Watson-Crick to Hoogsteen configurations, methylation patterns, and structural extensions. It also provides robust analytical capabilities for MD simulations, calculating geometric properties, curvature, and protein-DNA interaction profiles.

## Installation
To install MDNA, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mdna.git
```

## Usage

See our [documentation page](https://heezch.github.io/pymdna/)
