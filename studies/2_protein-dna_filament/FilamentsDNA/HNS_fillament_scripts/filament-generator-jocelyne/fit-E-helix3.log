Reading first structure file

Containing 10092 atoms in 631 residues
Select group from first structure
Group     0 (C-alpha_&_chE_&_r_55-64) has    10 elements
There is one group in the index

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary.
